Photos and specs of working on the carbs for the first time since I got the bike. It's very un-blog like, but I'm going to update this page as I go.


Air pilot screw, # of turns out:

1. 3-1/4
2. 2-1/8
3. 3-1/2
4. 2-1/4

## Intake Ports

Not sure if this matters at this point, but #2 seems to be running leaner than the others.

## Carb #4

I took carb #4 off first so I wouldn't have to mess with the choke lever.
