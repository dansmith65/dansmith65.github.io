This website is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages] via [Jekyll] (i.e. a "static" website). The [source code][repo] is available for all to see and each page has a corresponding file on the server. There is *no* code running on the server to generate content on a per-view basis. This is great for speed and ease of hosting, but bad for dynamic content like comments. Luckily for me, I'm not the first person to run into this issue so I was able to leverage the work of others. Comment's are submitted to [Staticman], which converts the comment into a [pull request], which allows me to moderate comments which end up as [just another file] in the source code of my website. I referred to various blogs to help set this up, but mostly used [Made Mistakes Blog] and [Minimal Mistakes Theme] as a template, so thanks Michael Rose!

I especially want to thank Eduardo Bou√ßas, the creator of [Staticman]. He solved a common problem in an elegant way, released it as open source, then to top it off he hosts the service for free!

Comments pending moderation can be found via [GitHub Issues]. If you want to modify your comment, you could fork the [repo], change your comment, and submit a pull request. I don't really expect anybody to want to do that, but I find it intriguing that you can!
