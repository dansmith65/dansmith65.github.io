  Hi Daniel, found the link to your site on XS11.com forum. I have a set of
  carbs from unknown XS11, I was going to put them on a 2H9 Euro engined XS11.
  The carbs came with no main jets and whilst looking through specs I thought
  I'd find out which model XS11 these carbs are for so I could try standard jets
  first. Looking through the specs there were many similar jets on different
  models, the one thing that was different to all models was the jet Needle, I
  stripped that out to find I have 5GLZ18 needles, the same as yours. I'm
  guessing I have '80 SG carbs same as yours. I should go with the 110 jets but
  as I'm running pods whilst plying with different carbs, I'll go up to 112.5
  (and I have have some which kinda help me decide the starting point)

  Just thought I'd let you know you weren't alone in having odd needles in what
  look like stock carbs.
