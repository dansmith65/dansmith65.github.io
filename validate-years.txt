{% comment %}
	To be able to list posts by year they were published, a file must exist in the posts_by_year
	collection for each year that posts exist for. The name of the file must be the year, and it
	must contain frontmater, but nothing else is required.
	This file verifies that a "year" file exist for every post's publish date.
	
	If one doesn't exist:
		a build error can be triggered by adding this to the end of the for loop:
			{% include year_missing %}
		or the file can contain a list of missing items by using this instead:
			{{year}}
{% endcomment %}

{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% assign year = post.date | date: "%Y" %}
  {% assign found = false %}
  
  {% for doc in site.posts_by_year %}
    {% if year == doc.slug %}
	  {% assign found = true %}
	  {% break %}
	{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  
  {% unless found %}
    {{year}} |
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
