	To be able to list posts by tag, a file must exist in the posts_by_tag collection for
	every tag used on a post. The name of the file must be the tag name, and it must
	contain frontmater, but nothing else is required.
	
	This file verifies that a "tag" file exist for every post's tags.
	
	Tag names should be lower case!
	
	I'm not sure if I need to slugify tag names; I may need to come back to this if it
	causes issues.
	
	If one doesn't exist:
		a build error can be triggered by adding this to the end of the for loop:
			{% include tag_missing %}
		or the file can contain a list of missing items by using this instead:
			|slug:{{tag_slug}}|title:{{tag_name}}|
{% endcomment %}

{% for tag in site.tags %}
  {% assign tag_name = tag.first %}
  {% assign tag_slug = tag_name | slugify %}
  {% assign found = false %}
  
  {% for doc in site.posts_by_tag %}
    {% if tag_slug == doc.slug and tag_slug == tag_name %}
	  {% assign found = true %}
	  {% break %}
	{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  
  {% unless found %}
    {{tag_slug}} |
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
